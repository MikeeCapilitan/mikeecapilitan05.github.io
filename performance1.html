    <br>
   - Hi, my name is Mikee Climaco Capilitan, turning 17 years old this December and living in El Dorado Dulo Baranggay Don Bosco Parañaque City. I graduated high school in Don Bosco National High School Parañaque with an honor. My hobbies is resting, eating, watching animes and cartoon movies and playing online games
is what I love the most. I'm really scared of cockroaches that was flying and lovecats specially the little ones. Lastly, I have a complete family that I'm really proud of and a god whose always beside me. </p> </div>

  <h1 style="font-size:18px;"> WHY DID I ENROLL AN ICT STUDENT? WHY NOT OTHER TRACK OR STRAND? </h1>
  <br>
 - I'll answer the first question, I enroll as an ICT student because I'm interested in computer and thinking ICT strand will gave me more knowledge about computer. I'm not really fully pick this strand before because I also want being a STEM student. Searching which strand will benefit me in the future because
I really wanted to pick STEM strand than ICT strand not until I discover there's more needed to learn in computer and then I finally decided which course I will be in the future. So in short, I pick this strand because it will gave me more knowledge about computer more than anything else and realize in end that I love
  ICT strand more than anything else. </p> </div>

    <h1 style="font-size:18px;">WHAT IS YOUR DREAM JOB? HOW DO YOU THINK WILL THIS COURSE WILL HELP YOU IN PURSUING YOUR CAREER? </h1> <br>
- I didn't totally decided which job will I will be or what job I really want the most
but I can say computer is really what I love. Wanting computer means also deciding what job I will pick in the future, I'm grade 11 so far so I didn't really bother myself about it and focus in my study first. I also agreed to think that this course will help me to pursue my career because wanting computer is also a sign
    that I will have a job that I can be fit of not now but in the future. </p> </div>

    <h1 style="font-size:18px;">TO WHOM AM I DEDICATING MY SUCESS IN FINISHING COURSE? YOURSELF, FAMILY, FRIENDS, SPECIAL SOMEONE ETC. WHY? </h1> <br>
- Since I was young I've decided to whom I will dedicate my success and that answer will be my family. I want them to feel also the happiness that I achieve and wanted to make them happy in this achievement of mine. If I will succeed, I'll firstly thank god for being in my side the most and secondly my family who were their to support me, my friends who game me encourage to do what I should do and lastly my special someone who support, trust and accept me for who I am and because of them, I can figure I'll be successful one day, in Jesus name, amen!
